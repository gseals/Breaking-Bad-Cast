*** SPOILER ALERT ***

The info in this project reflects character states as they end the show "Breaking Bad." If you have not seen the show and want to be surprised, stop where you are, go watch all 5 seasons, then come back and check out this project. Or, just don't mouse hover over any of the character cards.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/YaioUnMw0mo) as reference.

# Breaking Bad Cast version 1.0

## Description

* This application pulls from the [Breaking Bad API](https://breakingbadapi.com/documentation) and displays 63 character images from the TV show "Breaking Bad". Hovering over any of the images reveals a character's actor's name, nickname, date of birth, and status (alive or dead). Additionally, the search box at the top of the screen allows users to filter the results by character name.
